# SymbiFlow - Google Season of Docs

Google Season of Docs is a program aiming to expand the reach of open source
by bringing together open source and technical writers communities, with good
documentation being a primary facilitating factor in this process. As part of
the program we are looking for ambitious technical writers who would like to
use this opportunity to get involved in our open source FPGA toolchain project,
SymbiFlow, and contribute to work that will revolutionize the FPGA landscape
by enabling new, more software-oriented workflows and more vendor-neutral,
collaborative, modular and open development.

We are looking for a technical writer who can help us define a set of clear
guidelines on using and contributing to SymbiFlow. More information about the
project can be found on our GSOD 2021
[project proposal page](https://symbiflow.github.io/GSoD-2021-Application).

Interested technical writers should reach out to us via
[mail](mailto:contact@symbiflow.org)/[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/symbiflow/shared_invite/enQtNTkyMjcyNTkzOTY4LTU0MzhmYWNjOGMyMTkyNjA0MmEyMWM5OWY3ZDg5MWQ3ODlmOWQwZjk2YzBmMDBjMzkzMzNjYjkwYjAxZTMyNjQ)/[IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.libera.chat/#symbiflow).
You should also familiarize yourself with the guidelines for technical writers on Google's Season od Docs website:
